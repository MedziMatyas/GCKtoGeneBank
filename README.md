# GCKtoGeneBank
A bulk file converter to export Gene Construction Kit sequence files to the GenBank format.

Gene Construction Kit (GCK) is a great program for annotating DNA sequences, but the older versions lack any export functions that make these files compatible with other sequence visualisation or annotation programs. This has been introduced in version 4.0, but it still means that older files need to be exported one by one.

This program aims to alleviate this problem by converting DNA sequences stored and annotated in GCK to the commonly used GenBank file format.
